#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expositry
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 Half Adder : Circuit shown in simulator 1 has two led bulbs to show sum and carry respectively. Bulbs glow when output of circuit on particular terminal is 1 or high based on input provided.<br>
 simulator 2 is for assessment of the knowledge which user gains by working on simulator 1. Provide binary input to the simulator, Predict the output of half adder and verify it by truth table. <br>  <br>

Full Adder : Circuit shown in simulator 1 has two led bulbs to show sum and carry respectively. Output of the circuit depends on two inputs and Cin. Bulbs glow when output of the circuit on that terminal is 1 or high.<br>
simulator 2 is for assessment of the knowledge which user gains by working on simulator 1. Provide binary input to the simulator, Predict the output of half adder and verify it by truth table.
